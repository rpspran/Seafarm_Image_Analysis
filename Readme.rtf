This work was done at Sea6 Energy, Bengaluru when I lent technical support for the Ocean Engineering Team.

The objective of the project is to enable periodic tracking of seaplant growth in floating ocean farms, by developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for dynamic interpretation of drone acquired images.
1) Application of Aspect Ratio Preservation for Seaweed Farm images.ipynb: demonstrates development of an algorithm that considers two different techniques for performing the perspective transform warping. The agenda is to maintain the optimal aspect ratio on the seaweed farm images.

2) Algorithm_1.ipynb, Algorithm_2.ipynb and Algorithm_3.ipynb are different algorithms that have been developed for the seafarm image analysis problem. The notebooks illustrate the case for one particular image.

3) GUI_Interface.ipynb  - A GUI interface for demonstrating the algorithm3 approach.
